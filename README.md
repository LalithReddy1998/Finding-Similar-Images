# Finding-Similar-Images

step_1: Open "Size Image"
        open the file in jupyter NoteBook/google colab
	Change the location of "Dataset" folder
	Create a new folder in "Dataset" folder named as "filteredImages"  

This part of code will take all the images in "Dataset" and resize them in "512*512" size 
and put them in another folder called "filteredImages"


Step_2: Open "Finding_Similar_Images"
	open the file in jupyter NoteBook/google colab
	Change the location of image_path in cell 2 to "filteredImages"  
	
This part of code will find similar images of a given input image, it finds 5 similar images 
with "similarity score", if we want we can change the limit in cell 2. This code execution 
will some takes time.
